This directory provides examples and best practices for building image classification systems. We use fast.ai heavily, since it has rich feature support and ...


## Getting Started

To setup on your local machine:
1. Install Anaconda with Python >= 3.6. [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) is a quick way to get started.
2. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ComputerVisionBestPractices
    ```
3. [work in progress]
4. Activate the conda environment and register it with Jupyter:
    ```
    conda activate cvbp
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name cvbp --display-name "Python (cvbp)"
    ```
5. Start the Jupyter notebook server
    ```
    cd notebooks
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5. Run the [SAR Python CPU Movielens](notebooks/00_quick_start/sar_python_cpu_movielens.ipynb) notebook under the 00_quick_start folder. Make sure to change the kernel to "Python (reco)".


## Notebooks

We provide several notebooks to show how image classification algorithms can be designed, evaluated and operationalized.
