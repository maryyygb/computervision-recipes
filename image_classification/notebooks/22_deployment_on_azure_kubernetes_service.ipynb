    "In many real life scenarios, trained machine learning models need to be deployed to production. As we saw in the [first](https://github.com/Microsoft/ComputerVision/blob/staging/image_classification/notebooks/21_deployment_on_azure_container_instances.ipynb) deployment notebook, this can be done by deploying on Azure Container Instances. In this tutorial, we will get familiar with another way of implementing a model into a production environment, this time using [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads) (AKS).\n",

    "Here, we used Standard D3 V2 machines, which come with a temporary storage of 200 GB. Over the course of this tutorial (assuming ~ 1 hour), this added less than $1 to our bill. Now, it is important to understand that each hour during which the cluster is up gets billed, whether the web service is called or not. The same is true for the ACI and workspace we have been using until now.\n",
