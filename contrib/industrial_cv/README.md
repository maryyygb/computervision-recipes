# Computer Vision contrib repository

The purpose of this contribution sub-repository is to provide cutting-edge Computer Vision IP which does not align in the interim with CVBP repo; IP is organized by industry verticals such as healthcare, seismic workloads, assembly lines, etc. Folder structure is as follows:
  * `scripts`: various scripts such as setup or startup scripts which are needed.
  * `cv_lib`: contrib computer vision library source code folder, please see `cv_lib\README.md` for more details.
  * `docs`: documentation (eventually auto-generated from the Python code) of various modules, mostly in the `cv_lib` folder.
  * `tests`: contains unit and integration tests, please see `tests\README.md` for more details.
