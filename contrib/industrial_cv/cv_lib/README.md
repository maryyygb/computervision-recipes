# Computer Vision Utilities

This module contains functions to simplify common tasks used when developing and evaluating industrial CV applications. A short description of the sub-modules is provided below. For more details about what functions are available and how to use them, please review the doc-strings provided with the code.

## Sub-Modules

The code in `cv_lib` folder is organised by CV area, for example:
  * `segmentation.model` deals with segmentation models whereas dataset loaders would be in `segmentation.dataset` namespace
  * other CV domains would be in sub-folders of `cv_lib` folder, such as `cv_lib.classification.model` or `cv_lib.object_detection.dataset`, etc
