# Computer Vision Best Practices

This repository will provide examples and best practices for building Computer Vision systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks, and using PyTorch as Deep Learning library. Image classification will be covered first, followed by object detection and image similarity.


## Planning etc documents

Currently all planning documents, etc are in the [CV Best-practices OneNote](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/VisionTextGladiators/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FVisionTextGladiators%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FCV%20best-practices) notebook. Furthermore, the [AI Best Practices Repositories team channels](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a9f9b6e1f750b4f769953b3a8e33a5fc3%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=1feb1708-59d1-4112-a293-2147a40eba2e&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) is used for discussions.

In the near future, Github will be used for feature planning, etc.
